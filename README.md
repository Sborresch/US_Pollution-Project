# Segment One:
## Topic
How the top four air pollutants (NO2, O3, SO2 and O3) have effected air quality across the United States over the last 16-years. 
Can we determine if these four gases are influential in predicting air pollution quality in the next decade?

## Questions We Want to Answer
1. What are the top 5 cities with the highest amount of total pollutants based on historic data?
3. What are the top 5 cities with highest amount of each major pollutant (NO2, O3, SO2 and O3) based on historic data?
4. What can we predict air pollution will look like in the next decade for the top 5 most polluted cities?
    - Utilize a trend line of the AQI from 2000-2016
    - Use a predictive machine learning model and explain the predictive rate and considerations for why it is that rate

## Why This Topic
All team members have an interest in how pollution effects the greater united states, as this is a prevelant issue within the Northern Utah area where team members live.

## Data Source
The data source is a CSV file with over 1 million observations colleced between 2000-2016 regarding air quality and the top four pollutants Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Ozone.
